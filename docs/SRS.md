# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to design and implement an admin dashboard system that allows administrators to efficiently manage products, track orders, and monitor inventory levels. The system will provide features for product management, order processing, low stock alerts, and dashboard analytics, ensuring admins can maintain up-to-date stock and respond quickly to business needs.

## Client/Admin Needs
The admin needs a secure dashboard to manage products and orders, monitor stock levels, receive alerts about low inventory, and access business analyticsâ€”all from an easy-to-use interface.

### Admin User Requirements

**Product Management:**
- Add new products to the inventory
- Edit existing product details (name, description, price, stock status)
- Delete products as needed
- View a list of all products and their current stock levels

**Order Management:**
- Create new orders and assign products/quantities
- Edit or update existing orders (status, items, quantities)
- View all orders, including status and details
- Cancel orders if necessary

**Inventory Monitoring & Alerts:**
- Receive real-time alerts for products that are low in stock
- View a list of all low-stock items to take prompt action

**Dashboard & Analytics:**
- View key statistics (total orders, sales, low-stock items)
- Access analytics on product demand and sales trends

**Authentication & Security:**
- Securely log in and out of the admin dashboard
- Manage personal profile and password
